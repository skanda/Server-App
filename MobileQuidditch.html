With many built in capabilities like high speed processors, high resolution screens, sensors and other services providing an ease of connecting and sharing between devices or through a cloud, it enables us to come up with innovative applications to use those underlying features.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We chose to utilize the NFC feature available to come up with a tangible game through novel interaction techniques offering the fun of manipulating the physical objects as a part of the game play. Mobile Quidditch offers the players with an innovative way of playing the physical Quidditch game by the use of their smartphones and the WiFi network by touching the devices to transfer the balls or going nearby NFC tags to get back the player&rsquo;s life or even knock out the opponent player by sending a message to disconnect that particular person&rsquo;s smartphone based on the MAC address stored in the central router. The following sections will describe the motivation for our project, the related work in this area, followed by a detail description of the design and finally the method of evaluation with the work plan</span></span></p>

			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After looking through the App store and doing some research in the field of NFC gaming, we found that a collaborated, multiplayer game with co-located players were not yet present in the market. Quidditch is a game played by the wizard students at Hogwarts mentioned in the Harry Potter book. Normal people like us also do play it. Its called Muggle Quidditch which has seven players in each team, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and 1 seeker. The sport is adapted using elements of rugby, dodgeball, tag, wrestling and lacrosse. The games is played in the area of a ice hockey field. Interestingly with the currently available Near Field technologies, high power processor enabled cell phones and reliable WiFi networks, we thought of bringing this game to an electronic version to make the experience more interesting and make people use their smartphones and WiFi routers for a multiplayer game. With the available infrastructure and a set of smartphones to play with, our idea of playing Quidditch on a mobile phone makes the game more intuitive and more fun.</span></span></p>

			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To explore a set of related work happening in the field of NFC gaming we used Google Scholar to find out the relevant research and ongoing projects. Out of the few we would like to share 3 of the games which are developed. HCI researchers are developing new games to evaluate new interaction methods made possible by NFC sensors or other sensing technologies such as accelerometers or capacitive sensors incorporated in pervasive mobile devices. Recent games do not rely on dedicated hardware to read barcodes, but make use of the camera integrated into modern smartphones</span></span></p>

In this game, a set of NFC tags are used along with the smartphone to play a game similar to the memory game where we need to find a pair of matching cards. What actually happens here is that the NFC tags are embedded in a sheet of paper with some kind of image information. The smartphones have a built in NFC reader into it. This tag reader is responsible for scanning the information present on the tag and store it internally on the phone in order to use it for matching another card with the same image. When the smartphone is hovered the second paper card, the tag reader looks for a match in the image and then prompts the result to the user. </span></span></p>

			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Another game known as NFC Heroes, was developed by researchers in Europe. It is a virtual trading card game for Android phones, inspired by Heroes of Might and Magic. Users in this games usually scan the NFC tags to unlock more powerful spells or heroes in this game. The spells can then be used to fight against monsters, collect coins, and compete against other players on a leaderboard. The integration with Facebook lets players share their victories and collected cards. The monster here in this game is computer controlled and competes against a hero controlled by the player. Android client is used to play the game with the NFC feature available built into it.</span></span></p>

The Touch Connect feature uses the NFC to enable users to simply touch two phones to connect and join the game. Secondly, Realsense uses orientation sensing to enable directional gestures to provide spatial interaction among players during the game. The domain of multiplayer gaming provides opportunity for socializing with friends, also enhancing user experience.</span></span></p>

			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After going through some of these games existing in the market, with the NFC and the Android Beam touch to transfer files or other data, we found a few collaborative applications like Bump on iOS which is basically a contact sharing application which can be used at meeting places to share contacts instead of business cards. There could be other use of collaborated sharing application where some documents or videos could be shared between a set of registered users from a controlled central authority. With the existence of these set of applications we thought of a novel game using the features of NFC and Android Beam (touch to transfer) to come up with an innovative application which could group the co-located players and play a game which would require actual physical objects with an electronic version to make it more intuitive.</span></span></p>

			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The topology we plan to use consists of a 2 Wifi routers along with a central server which can configured on a laptop. The central server is the machine where it has all the current information related to the game like where the snitch is which player has the quaffle or the bludger. It is also responsible for maintaining the scoreboard. The snitch keeps randomly moving between the Wifi routers making it accessible to the players only for a few seconds by sending a notification to capture within seconds. In order to offer a seamless connectivity during the course of the game between the routers we plan to use a DD-WRT firmware over the existing routers enabling a seamless transfer. As shown in the topology, to transfer a Quaffle between players, the two players must touch their phones which internally uses NFC and Android Beam to transfer the file, also updating the server simultaneously about the information as to who has what kind of balls are with which player. If a player wants to knock off the opponent, he can get to know about the visibility of the opponent and send a knock off message to the server which blocks the opponent disconnecting the Wifi. This is done based on the MAC address of the smartphone.</span></span></p>

			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The main design plan of the game is based on the two level interaction between players. Via the use of NFC as well as traditional WiFi message exchanges, we wish to allow the player to interact with the game in multiple ways. In the following section, we elaborate on this idea. First we will specify the technical details of the game&rsquo;s infrastructure.</span></span></p>
		<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">
			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The game is run from a Server connected to a router. This server is responsible for maintaining the state of the game at all time as well as starting and ending it. Thus overall, the game follows a Client-Server model with the Android phones as clients.</span></span></p>
		<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;">
			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Server acts as both a monitoring system as well as rule-enforcement system. It is the job of the server program to keep track of all activities within the game and trigger appropriate responses as necessary.</span></span></p>
		<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;">
			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Each player interacts with the game through the Mobile app on their Android phone. This allows the user to start a game or join an existing game and is the single point of interaction for a player. </span></span></p>
		<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;">
			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The phones interact via WiFi with routers that allow players over a wider area. In essence, all players in the game are part of a single WiFi LAN. </span></span></p>
		<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;">
			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In addition, any pair of players can interact with each other through the use of NFC. To keep the game state consistent for all players, all of these interactions and the changes they bring about are reported to the Server running the game. </span></span></p>
		<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;">
			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We also plan to use NFC Tags which enable players to re-enter the game once they have been knocked out. This adds to the physical nature of the game and makes it more interactive with the environment.</span></span></p>
		<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;">
			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">To increase the physical space the game can be played in, we wish to incorporate multiple WiFi routers that allow us to extend the WiFi LAN. Thus we have to be careful about handoffs between these routers when the phones move in and out of their range.</span></span></p>

The server program is in charge of pushing these scores to the phones as quickly as possible. </span></span></p>
		<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;">

Depending on the game state and rules, these can prompt a variety of effects. In the next section we give a detailed account of the games rules and how they are implemented by the server program.</span></span></p>
		<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">
			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The gameplay is real-time with actions of all players reflected in the game. Due to the rules of the game, each player is aware only of his/her actions and the score. Being a team game, the players can collaborate with team mates on a common strategy. </span></span></p>
		<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;">
			<span id="docs-internal-guid-23f91218-8d0f-e710-7d0a-43c0b30e9d8f"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As the game is based on Quidditch, the server will incorporate randomness into server-initiated events like ball distribution, snitch visibility,etc. This means the game itself can last many hours or few minutes. We will try to put some limits on this functionality to make sure the game extends for a reasonable amount of time. We also want the game to be more exciting, hence we will try to incorporate some level of intelligence into the server program to make the situations more challenging for better teams.</span></span></p>

We require a few routers with access to LAN cables in a suitable staging area where multiple players can move around. We will also be embedding the NFC tags at suitable places within this environment. We want to show that the game is very quick in responding to the player&rsquo;s actions while keeping the gameplay interesting and engaging. We will further show through the movement of the players and their interactions via NFC that the server program can handle the various actions as well as infrastructural issues like handover. </span></span></p>
