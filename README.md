Server-App
==========
Use the Server.java file in the Server directory.

Create a Java Project with the following package name - com.quidditch.server.

Copy the Server.java contents by creating a separating class and your server is ready to run! :)

NOTE: Too much work is being done on a single Reciever thread. Will try to improve by adding MT feature.
